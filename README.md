# 🧱 IIP_SECURE_STACK

**Inner Infinite Power™ Secure Stack**  
A private, full-stack DevSecOps architecture for secure AI, data, and automation systems.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

IIP_SECURE_STACK is a modular, containerized framework designed for creators, researchers, and enterprises prioritizing **security, automation, and AI integration**.  
It provides a **self-owned infrastructure** for running large language models (LLMs), analytics pipelines, and data services—without dependency on third-party SaaS platforms.

**Use cases:**
- Secure deployment of AI and analytics workloads
- Private LLM inference and experimentation
- Automated observability and compliance pipelines
- End-to-end wellness or performance platforms

---

## ⚙️ System Overview

| Layer | Description | Key Components |
|:------|:-------------|:----------------|
| **1. Infrastructure Layer** | Base containers, networking, and persistent data volumes. | Docker, Nginx, Gunicorn, Redis |
| **2. Database Layer** | Centralized data persistence and caching. | PostgreSQL, DuckDB |
| **3. API & Logic Layer** | Handles AI, SQL, and service orchestration. | Flask, Llama-cpp-Python |
| **4. Frontend & Visualization Layer** | Real-time dashboards and visual analytics. | Streamlit, Apache Superset |
| **5. Observability & Security Layer** | System health, metrics, and alerting. | Grafana, Loki, Promtail |
| **6. CI/CD & Automation Layer** | Automated builds, tests, and deployments. | GitHub Actions, Docker Compose |
| **7. AI ↔ SQL Bridge Layer (Phase 12)** | Local inference pipeline linking models to databases. | `llama_cpp.server`, `Phi-2 GGUF`, Flask API |

---

## 🧩 Phase 12 — AI ↔ SQL Bridge Integration

This phase creates a **live, secure bridge** between your local AI model and SQL data engine.  
It enables contextual query translation, automated data analysis, and GPT-compatible endpoints.

**Pipeline:**
1. Flask server listens on `localhost:5001`
2. LLM (Phi-2, GGUF format) served via `llama_cpp.server`
3. Secure bridge handles `POST /query` → SQL engine
4. Result formatted and returned through JSON

**Result:**  
A functional private AI gateway—no external API calls, fully containerized, auditable, and scalable.

IIP_SECURE_STACK enforces multiple layers of defense:

- **Container Security:** Minimal base images, no root processes.  
- **Network Isolation:** Internal bridge networks and restricted ports.  
- **Secrets Management:** `.env` variables encrypted and mounted securely.  
- **TLS Enforcement:** All communications use HTTPS with verified certificates.  
- **Audit Logging:** Continuous monitoring through Grafana + Loki.  
- **Dependency Scans:** Automated weekly via GitHub Actions.

---

## 🧠 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
